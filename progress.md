# Progress Log

## 2025-03-20: Redis Connection and Queue Testing

### Completed Tasks

- **Redis Connection Testing**:
  - Created comprehensive test scripts to validate Redis connections with proper error handling and timeouts.
  - Identified that the Railway proxy (`caboose.proxy.rlwy.net:58064`) provides reliable access to the Redis instance from external environments.
  - Updated connection configuration to use the proxy for local development while maintaining the internal connection for production.

- **Queue Testing**:
  - Successfully tested adding jobs to both `my-queue` and `send-email-queue` using the Railway proxy.
  - Implemented tests for both regular and scheduled jobs.
  - Verified job counts and queue status.

- **Test Scripts Created**:
  - `test-redis-config.ts`: Tests various Redis connection configurations with timeouts and error handling.
  - `test-proxy-jobs.ts`: Tests adding jobs to queues using the Railway proxy.
  - `test-bull-board.ts`: Tests Bull Board UI connectivity and job management.
  - `test-connections.ts`: Comprehensive test for various Redis connections.
  - `test-direct.ts`: Tests direct connection to a Redis instance.
  - `test-railway.ts`: Tests remote queue functionality on Railway.
  - `test-jobs.ts`: Tests local queue functionality.

### Lessons Learned

- Railway provides a TCP proxy that allows external connections to internal services.
- Always implement connection timeouts and proper error handling when testing Redis connections.
- Environment-specific configuration is essential for applications that need to run in different environments.

### Next Steps

- Monitor the Bull Board UI for job status after adding jobs to verify functionality.
- Implement more comprehensive error handling in the main application.
- Consider adding health checks to verify Redis connectivity on application startup.

## 2025-03-20: SMS Queue Implementation

### Completed Tasks

- **SMS Queue System**:
  - Created two separate queues for SMS processing: `send-sms-queue` for immediate delivery and `scheduled-sms-queue` for scheduled messages.
  - Implemented SMS schema validation using Zod.
  - Added SMS workers to process both immediate and scheduled SMS jobs.
  - Updated the Bull Board UI to display and monitor SMS queues.

- **Enhanced Authentication**:
  - Improved Bull Board UI authentication using environment variables.
  - Added proper error handling for authentication failures.

- **Health Check Endpoint**:
  - Added a `/health` endpoint to verify server status.

- **Test Scripts Created**:
  - `test-sms-queues.ts`: Tests adding jobs to SMS queues using the Railway proxy.

### Lessons Learned

- Separating immediate and scheduled jobs into different queues provides better organization and monitoring capabilities.
- Using environment variables for authentication credentials enhances security and flexibility.

### Next Steps

- Implement actual SMS sending logic using Twilio or another SMS provider.
- Add more comprehensive logging for SMS job processing.
- Consider implementing rate limiting for SMS sending to avoid hitting provider limits.

## 2025-03-21: SMS API Integration

### Completed Tasks

- **SMS API Integration**:
  - Integrated SMS sending functionality with the external SMS API at `/api/messages`.
  - Updated SMS schema to include required fields for the API: `contactId` and `workspaceId`.
  - Implemented SMS workers to process both immediate and scheduled SMS jobs and send them to the API.
  - Created a test script (`test-sms-api.ts`) to validate the end-to-end SMS sending process.

- **Redis Connection Improvements**:
  - Updated Redis connection configuration to support multiple connection methods (internal, proxy, and public URL).
  - Implemented proper error handling for Redis connection failures.
  - Added graceful shutdown handling to ensure jobs are not lost when the service is stopped.

- **Environment Configuration**:
  - Added environment variables for SMS API URL and authentication.
  - Updated worker configuration to use the appropriate Redis connection based on the environment.

### Lessons Learned

- When integrating with external APIs, it's important to validate input data and handle errors properly.
- Using separate queues for immediate and scheduled jobs provides better organization and monitoring.
- Different Redis connection strategies are needed for different environments (local development vs. production).

### Next Steps

- Monitor the SMS sending process to ensure messages are being delivered correctly.
- Add more comprehensive logging for API responses.
- Implement retry logic for failed API calls.
- Consider adding metrics to track SMS delivery rates and failures.

## 2025-03-21: SMS API Integration (Updated)

### Completed Tasks
- Updated SMS worker to use the correct API endpoint `/send-sms` instead of `/api/messages`
- Fixed issue with field naming in the API requests (using `message` instead of `content`)
- Successfully tested direct API integration with a valid phone number
- Added detailed logging for API requests and responses
- Updated environment variable configuration for the SMS API URL
- Added comprehensive error handling for API responses
- Updated documentation with lessons learned from the SMS API integration

### Challenges
- Redis connection issues when connecting from local environment to remote instances
- Required fields not being properly passed to the API
- Determining the correct API endpoint structure and field naming conventions

### Next Steps
- Deploy both worker and queue service to the same environment for reliable Redis connectivity
- Implement monitoring for SMS delivery status
- Add retry logic for failed SMS deliveries
- Create a dashboard for tracking SMS delivery metrics
