  - Successfully tested schema validation with various input types.

- **Static File Serving**:
  - Simplified static file serving configuration to serve files directly from the root path.
  - Removed custom route handlers for serving HTML files, allowing the static plugin to handle them directly.
  - Updated the static file serving configuration to use the correct paths for production.

- **API Testing**:
  - Successfully tested both email and SMS API endpoints using curl.
  - Verified that both immediate and scheduled jobs are being added to the queues correctly.

  - Documented the Bull Board UI access and authentication.
  - Provided detailed integration instructions for other applications.

### Lessons Learned

- When using union types in Zod, validation methods like `.min()` cannot be chained directly on the union. Instead, they must be applied to each member of the union separately.
- Always implement and test API endpoints independently from UI components. This allows you to verify core functionality even when there are issues with the UI layer.
- Breaking down troubleshooting into smaller, focused steps helps isolate and fix issues more effectively than trying to solve everything at once.

### Next Steps

- Continue troubleshooting static file serving issues for the test UI.
- Implement comprehensive monitoring for both email and SMS delivery.
- Add more detailed logging for API requests and responses.
- Consider implementing a webhook system for delivery status notifications.
