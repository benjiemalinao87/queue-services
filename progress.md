# Progress Log

## 2025-03-20: Redis Connection and Queue Testing

### Completed Tasks

- **Redis Connection Testing**:
  - Created comprehensive test scripts to validate Redis connections with proper error handling and timeouts.
  - Identified that the Railway proxy (`caboose.proxy.rlwy.net:58064`) provides reliable access to the Redis instance from external environments.
  - Updated connection configuration to use the proxy for local development while maintaining the internal connection for production.

- **Queue Testing**:
  - Successfully tested adding jobs to both `my-queue` and `send-email-queue` using the Railway proxy.
  - Implemented tests for both regular and scheduled jobs.
  - Verified job counts and queue status.

- **Test Scripts Created**:
  - `test-redis-config.ts`: Tests various Redis connection configurations with timeouts and error handling.
  - `test-proxy-jobs.ts`: Tests adding jobs to queues using the Railway proxy.
  - `test-bull-board.ts`: Tests Bull Board UI connectivity and job management.
  - `test-connections.ts`: Comprehensive test for various Redis connections.
  - `test-direct.ts`: Tests direct connection to a Redis instance.

- Successfully tested direct API integration with a valid phone number
- Added detailed logging for API requests and responses
- Updated environment variable configuration for the SMS API URL
- Added comprehensive error handling for API responses
- Updated documentation with lessons learned from the SMS API integration

### Challenges
- Redis connection issues when connecting from local environment to remote instances
- Required fields not being properly passed to the API
- Determining the correct API endpoint structure and field naming conventions

### Next Steps
- Deploy both worker and queue service to the same environment for reliable Redis connectivity
- Implement monitoring for SMS delivery status
- Add retry logic for failed SMS deliveries
- Create a dashboard for tracking SMS delivery metrics

## 2025-03-21: Email Queue Implementation

### Completed Tasks

- **Email Queue System**:
  - Created two separate queues for email processing: `send-email-queue` for immediate delivery and `scheduled-email-queue` for scheduled emails.
  - Implemented email schema validation using Zod with required fields: `to`, `subject`, `html`, `contactId`, and `workspaceId`.
  - Added email workers to process both immediate and scheduled email jobs.
  - Updated the Bull Board UI to display and monitor email queues.

- **Email API Integration**:
  - Integrated email sending functionality with the external email API at `/api/email/send`.
  - Implemented email workers to process both immediate and scheduled email jobs and send them to the API.
  - Created a test script (`test-email-queues.ts`) to validate the end-to-end email sending process.

- **UI for Testing**:
  - Created a user-friendly UI for testing email scheduling (`test-email.html`).
  - Added a landing page with links to all test UIs and API documentation.
  - Implemented proper static file serving for the UI files.

- **API Endpoints**:
  - Added `/api/schedule-email` endpoint for scheduling emails with optional delay.
  - Updated the API to handle both immediate and scheduled email delivery.

- **Environment Configuration**:
  - Added environment variables for Email API URL.
  - Updated documentation to reflect the new email functionality.

### Lessons Learned

- When deploying to production, it's important to use a reliable method for serving static files that works across different environments.
- Using `process.cwd()` is more reliable than `import.meta.url` for determining file paths in production environments.
- Providing a comprehensive landing page with links to all functionality makes testing and demonstration easier.

### Next Steps

- Monitor the email sending process to ensure messages are being delivered correctly.
- Add more comprehensive logging for API responses.
- Implement retry logic for failed API calls.
- Consider adding metrics to track email delivery rates and failures.

## 2025-03-21: Production Deployment and Testing

### Completed Tasks

- **Schema Validation Fixes**:
  - Fixed Zod schema validation issues for both email and SMS schemas.
  - Updated union type validation to use `z.union()` instead of `z.string().or(z.number())` to properly handle validation for both string and number types.
  - Successfully tested schema validation with various input types.

- **Static File Serving**:
  - Simplified static file serving configuration to serve files directly from the root path.
  - Removed custom route handlers for serving HTML files, allowing the static plugin to handle them directly.
  - Updated the static file serving configuration to use the correct paths for production.

- **API Testing**:
  - Successfully tested both email and SMS API endpoints using curl.
  - Verified that both immediate and scheduled jobs are being added to the queues correctly.
  - Confirmed that the Bull Board UI is accessible and displaying the correct queue information.

- **Documentation Updates**:
  - Updated the instructions.md file with current environment variables.
  - Added comprehensive API testing examples using curl.
  - Documented the Bull Board UI access and authentication.
  - Provided detailed integration instructions for other applications.

### Lessons Learned

- When using union types in Zod, validation methods like `.min()` cannot be chained directly on the union. Instead, they must be applied to each member of the union separately.
- Always implement and test API endpoints independently from UI components. This allows you to verify core functionality even when there are issues with the UI layer.
- Breaking down troubleshooting into smaller, focused steps helps isolate and fix issues more effectively than trying to solve everything at once.

### Next Steps

- Continue troubleshooting static file serving issues for the test UI.
- Implement comprehensive monitoring for both email and SMS delivery.
- Add more detailed logging for API requests and responses.
- Consider implementing a webhook system for delivery status notifications.

- Visualizing metrics helps identify problematic patterns more quickly than raw data
- TypeScript's strict null checking helps prevent runtime errors by catching potential issues at compile time
- Implementing a dashboard within the same service can be efficient when the dashboard is primarily displaying data already available to the service

### Next Steps

- Implement automated alerts when workspaces repeatedly exceed rate limits
- Consider adding tiered rate limits based on customer subscription levels
- Enhance the dashboard with historical data visualization over longer time periods
- Add export functionality for metrics data to support further analysis
