- [x] Create test scripts for local queue functionality
- [x] Create test scripts for remote queue functionality
- [x] Implement Railway proxy connection for local development
- [x] Test adding jobs to queues using the Railway proxy
- [x] Implement SMS queue system (immediate and scheduled delivery)
- [x] Enhance Bull Board UI authentication
- [x] Add health check endpoint
- [x] Implement Email queue system (immediate and scheduled delivery)
- [x] Create test UI for SMS and Email scheduling

## In Progress

- [ ] Implement comprehensive error handling in the main application
- [ ] Add health checks to verify Redis connectivity on application startup
- [ ] Monitor job processing and completion

## Planned

### Short-term

- [ ] Integrate Twilio for actual SMS sending
- [ ] Implement retry strategies for failed jobs
- [ ] Add more detailed logging for job processing
- [ ] Create a dashboard for monitoring queue performance
- [ ] Implement rate limiting for SMS sending

### Medium-term

- [ ] Add support for message templates
- [ ] Implement job priorities
- [ ] Add support for bulk SMS sending
- [ ] Implement job dependencies (jobs that depend on other jobs)
- [ ] Add analytics for message delivery and open rates

### Long-term

- [ ] Implement distributed worker scaling
- [ ] Add support for multiple Redis instances for high availability
- [ ] Implement job archiving for long-term storage
- [ ] Add support for additional messaging channels (WhatsApp, Messenger, etc.)

## Production Readiness Roadmap

To ensure the Queue Services system is fully production-ready, the following items should be addressed:

### Redis Reliability

- [ ] Configure proper Redis persistence (RDB/AOF)
- [ ] Implement Redis clustering or Redis Sentinel for high availability
- [ ] Set up monitoring for Redis memory usage and performance
- [ ] Create automated backup procedures for Redis data
- [ ] Document recovery procedures for Redis failures

### Worker Scaling

- [ ] Implement multi-process worker architecture
- [ ] Configure auto-scaling based on queue size
- [ ] Add load balancing for worker processes
- [ ] Implement graceful shutdown procedures to prevent job loss
- [ ] Add worker health monitoring

### Security Enhancements

- [ ] Enable TLS for all Redis connections
- [ ] Implement API authentication for queue endpoints
- [ ] Strengthen Bull Board access controls
- [ ] Conduct security audit of the entire system
- [ ] Implement proper secrets management

### Monitoring and Alerting

- [ ] Set up comprehensive logging for all job processing
- [ ] Configure alerts for failed jobs and queue backlogs
- [ ] Implement detailed metrics collection
- [ ] Create operational dashboards for system health
- [ ] Set up automated testing of the queue system

### Performance Optimization

- [ ] Conduct load testing with expected peak volumes
- [ ] Implement circuit breakers for external service calls
- [ ] Optimize job concurrency settings
- [ ] Implement rate limiting for external APIs
- [ ] Add performance benchmarking tools

### Disaster Recovery

- [ ] Document complete disaster recovery procedures
- [ ] Implement automated failover mechanisms
- [ ] Create regular backup verification processes
- [ ] Establish recovery time objectives (RTOs)
- [ ] Conduct regular disaster recovery drills
