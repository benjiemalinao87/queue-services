This is a texting app using twilio, its also like CRM for home improvement, coaches, and small business
Server hosted: Railway.app
Server: Nodejs Express
Database is supabase cloude. 

our outgoing sms and email is using queue-services.

always use use ES modules.

My end goal of this development is for me to be able to build a fully built simple crm with texting and calling functionality. To be able to use not only twilio as a backend but all other sms provider

Features in roadmap are project management, note taking, 3d maps for installer,invoicing, emdedable standalone livechat where 3rd party apps/crm can white label and iframe/embed inside their app.

database is not installed in docker so any fixing and troubleshooting you need to connect via cli and used credentials below



Instructions
1. Always use codebase_search with target_directories="{{INSERT YOUR DIRECTORY}}" first to find existing core files
2. Always check existing system files purposes before creating new ones with similar functionality
3. Always list the cursor rules youre using this is for debugging purpose
4. always use inviroment variable
5. every user request, you need to repeat it to test your understanding then use your own explaination to help you better understand the user requests.

Base Backend_url: cc.automate8.com

# Optional

- If multiple steps or sub-requests are given, address them in the specified order.
Provide answers in the exact format or sequence requested.
- Pay close attention to all stated constraints (e.g., language choice, performance goals, coding style). Do not ignore any requirement or best practice stated.
- Only produce output relevant to the question or instructions. Do not add features, code, or details beyond what is explicitly asked.
- Deliver the response in a minimal yet complete form. Avoid unnecessary verbosity and tangential remarks.


- stay consistent with the design of like Mac OS design philosophy. 

- do not create file if already existed.
- as much as possible for better integration with all part of the app, seperate each part of the UI in seperate file.


# Error Fixing
- Consider multiple possible causes before deciding. Do not jump to conclusions
- Explain the problem in plain English
- Make minimal necessary changes, changing as few lines of code as possible
- Always verify the fix
- In case of strange errors, ask the user to perform a web search to find the latest up-to-date information
- when the issue is fix, please remove the logging to avoide over head of cpu and memory

# Building Process

  2. Core Functionalities: A breakdown of what the app should do
  3. Docs and Libraries: Documentation or tools that will be referenced
  4. Current File Structure: A snapshot of existing files to provide clarity
5. once finish building the feature, if it is succesully, update the file progress.md, if not exist, please create it.
6. when building a ui, always do the backend/database design first, document the process and prepare for ui implementation the implementation doc.

Write each step in the process as simple and precise prompts.
Test each functionality after implementation.

# Automatically update documentation files after each significant change:
- progress.md: Track completed features and improvements
- lessons_learn.md: Document technical insights and solutions
- roadmap.md: Update progress and adjust future plans
- instructions.md: Maintain project overview and requirements

# Troubleshooting guide
1. Always look for UI then backend to make sure the UI operation is inligned with backend database or server
2. If you failed 2 times in fixing the bug, you need to put more logging, and use that log to formulate the solution. 
3. Monitor any logging to efffectively fix the issue.
4. connect directly to supabase using credential below for reviewing schema of tables for troubleshooting.
5. You need to send me one at a time instruction like sql command I need to enter in supabase if needed, but most of the time you need to fix database related directly to supabase sdk in cli.
6. before starting your bug fixing, you need to first repear the issue to make sure your understanding of the current issue. 
7. when the issue is fix, please remove the logging to avoide over head of cpu and memory
